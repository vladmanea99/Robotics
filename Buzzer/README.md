This is the homework for the lab with the buzzers.

I intake in an AnalogInput pin in arduino a buzzer so it can record vibrations.

If the input taken is greater than 600 than it'll wait 5 seconds and will play on the second buzzer a song hardcoded in the program.

The notes are predefined with the number of Hz of each required freq for each note.
