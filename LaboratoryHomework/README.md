Homework 1(13 LED)

I connect the LED to the 13th pin in arduino with anode and with cathode at ground and I put a rezistor to not burn the LED.
I then digitalWrite the 13th pin so the light of the LED would turn on or off

Homework 3 (RGB)

So the potentiometere has a ground pin, an input voltage pin and in input of analog readeable pin.

I attach 3 potentiometers to the arduino board in the A0 A1 and A2 as INPUTS

The RGB LED is cathod so the 3 pins for colors need to get a voltage through the wires and the longes pin is the one that is connected to the ground

I connect the 3 pins of colors through wires to the 3, 5 and 6 digital sockets in arduino and make them As an Analog Output.

I read the values of the 3 potentiometers in arduino, I map them to be between (0, 255) and then I connect each potentiometere to a color for the RGB LED.


Homework 4 (Buzzer)

This is the homework for the lab with the buzzers.

I intake in an AnalogInput pin in arduino a buzzer so it can record vibrations.

If the input taken is greater than 600 than it'll wait 5 seconds and will play on the second buzzer a song hardcoded in the program.

The notes are predefined with the number of Hz of each required freq for each note.
